AvaIre Stay Connected
=====================

Stay Connected is a super simple plugin that makes the bot stay connected to voice channels after music has ended.

> **Note:** This plugin will disable the music activity tracking within Ava to make the bot stay connected to all voice channels, regardless of inactivity, empty queues, no listeners, etc.

## How to Use

> **Note:** This assumes you're already self-hosting Ava, this plugin won't do anything on its own!

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/avaire/stay-connected-plugin/releases) off github and place the `.jar` file within the plugins folder.
2. Start up Ava to make Ava recognize the plugin.

And you're done!
